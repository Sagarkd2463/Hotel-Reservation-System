# Hotel-Reservation-System
Made this project using Java, JDBC &amp; MySQL.
I haven't written url, username & password for security purpose.
In simple words, JDBC is an API driver to connect our client with the database.
I have used Thin Driver database connectivity driver which is performance-oriented, scalable and works on any SQL platform.
